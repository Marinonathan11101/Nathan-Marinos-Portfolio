                <li>Piano: I am a self-taught piano player who strives to get better with every new piece that I play. I
                    have been playing for around four years now as I started around 2018. I mainly play tracks from
                    video games such as Final Fantasy. I wish to one day learn how to read sheet music so I could learn
                    without having to watch videos on the Internet.</li> <br>

                <li>Video Games: I have a great interest in video games and love to play them in my spare time. I mainly
                    play RPGS, platformers, and games in the horror genre.</li> <br>

                <li>Movies/TV shows: Occasionally, I enjoy watching movies and shows with my friends and cousins. Most
                    of the movies and shows we enjoy watching are all horror related. I have a huge interest in all
                    things horror, especially the paranormal. Some of my favorite horror movies include The Conjuring,
                    Hereditary, Halloween, and IT.</li> <br>

                <li>Reading: I enjoy reading in my spare time. I have just completed reading Stephen King's IT.</li>
