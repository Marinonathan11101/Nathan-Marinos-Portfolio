                <h2 style="font-size:xx-large"> Introduction</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Marino and I am an 18-year-old student currently attending Georgian College
                    to pursue a career in Computer Programming. As a freshman, I wish to learn more and develop my
                    skills in relation to the field. I have a significant passion for programming and wish to look back
                    in the future and observe the progress I have made. I believe that my skills will benefit me greatly
                    in the workforce. I possess skills such as time management, organization, creative thinking,
                    problem-solving, and decision-making.</p> <br>

                <p> I was born on Friday the 13th of August 2004. I live in Barrie, Ontario, Canada.</p> <br>
